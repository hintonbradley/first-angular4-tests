How to set up a basic Angular app:
Step 1: Install Angular/cli
    $ npm install -g @angular/cli
Step 2: Create and cd into the directory where you want your Angular app to live.
Step 2: Create your Angular app using angular-cli.
    $ng new name-of-app
Step 3: Cd into the new directory
    $ cd name-of-app
Step 4: To view your app, start the Angular server and view on http://localhost:4200
    $ng serve
Step 5: To create a new component use Angular cli. This will create a name-of-component.component.css file, a name-of-component.component.html file, a name-of-component.component.spec.tst file and a name-of-component.component.ts file.
    $ng g c name-of-component
Step 6: Go to app/app.module.ts file to register the new Components.
    @NgModule({
    ...
    declarations: [
        AppComponent,
        NameOfComponentComponent (Ex: UsersComponent)
    ],
    ...
Step 7: To create a new service use Angular cli. This will create a name-of-service.servicespec.ts file and a name-of-service.service.ts file.
    $ng g s name-of-service
Step 8: Go to app/app.module.ts file to register the new Service as a provider.
    @NgModule({
    ...
    providers: [
        NameOfServiceService (Ex: UsersService)
    ],
    ...
    })
